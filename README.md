<b>Thread Programming</b>
<br>This project involves creating a multithreaded Java program. It introduces concepts of thread creation, execution, and termination in Java while encouraging exploration of thread synchronization and shared resources. The project provides foundational knowledge in concurrent programming.

<br><b>Features</b></br>
  - <b>Thread Creation:</b> Implements threads using the Runnable interface and Thread class. Demonstrates how to start and manage threads in Java.
  - <b>Thread Termination:</b> Utilizes Thread.interrupt() to handle graceful thread termination by checking the interrupt flag.
  - <b>Concurrency Enhancements:</b> Allows dynamic thread creation based on command-line input. Implements delay variations for threads to simulate staggered execution. Shares a single counter between threads to illustrate resource sharing and synchronization.
